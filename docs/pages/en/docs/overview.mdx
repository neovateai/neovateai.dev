## Why Neovate Code?

There are so many code agents out there. Here are some features that make Neovate Code different from other code agents:

- Open Claude Code
- Easy to extend
- Multiple clients

Claude Code is a great code agent, but it is not open source, and can not be used with other models by default. Neovate Code learns a lot from Claude Code, including features and configurations and others. And based on this, we added supports for all popular models and providers. So it's a good choice if you want both.

Neovate Code is easy to extend. It has a built-in plugin system with much hooks. You can quickly create Your Own Code Agent with your own models, features, tools and other integrations. Companies like Ant Group and Kuaishou has already using it to build their own code agents.

Neovate Code is currently only have the CLI client, but we have make the architecture flexible enough to support multiple clients. So it's easy to extend to support other clients like IDE Extension, Web App, Native App and Remote Agent. And we're working on these.

## Interactive Mode

Start Neovate Code in headless mode by running `neovate` in your terminal. Describe what you want to do in the command line, review proposed changes and approve tools calls.

```bash
# Start in interactive mode
neovate

# With a initial prompt
neovate "Create testcase for @src/components/Button.tsx"
```

## Headless Mode

Headless mode is useful for automated workflows, CI/CD integration and scripts.

```bash
neovate -q "Review the changes"

# Stream JSON output
neovate -q --output-format stream-json "Review the changes"
```

## Sessions

Sessions could be resumed from the last state.

```bash
# Resume from the last session
neovate -c

# Resume from a specific session interactively
neovate /resume
```
