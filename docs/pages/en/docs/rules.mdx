# Rules

Neovate Code supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) file to provide custom instructions. You can use it to manage custom rules to guide AI behavior and ensure consistent code generation across your projects.

## File Location

Neovate Code supports both project and global scope. And both of them will work, they will be merged together to send to the LLMs.

### Project scope

Project scope `AGENTS.md` is located under your project root. This file will be used by the project and it's sub-directories.

### Global scope

You can also create a global AGENTS.md file in the `~/.neovate/AGENTS.md`. This file will be used by all projects.

## Set up project AGENTS.md

You can use `/init` slash command to set up a project `AGENTS.md` file quickly. This will scan the project and generate the `AGENTS.md` file, ncluding dev commands, code architecture, patterns, technology stack, dependencies, etc. If the `AGENTS.md` file already exists, it will be updated.

```bash
/init
```

<Callout type="info">
  You should commit the `AGENTS.md` file of your project to the git repository.
</Callout>
