# Output Style

Output style is used to customize the system prompt. So Neovate Code can do things beyond the code generation.

## Built-in output styles

|Output Style|Description|
|---|---|
|`Default`|The default output style|
|`Explanatory`|Explains its implementation choices and codebase patterns|

## Custom output styles

You can create your own output styles in both project and global scope.

### Project scope

Located under the `.neovate/output-styles` directory.

### Global scope

Located under the `~/.neovate/output-styles` directory.

### Frontmatter

Output style files support frontmatter.

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`name`|The name of the output style|
|`description`|The description of the output style|
|`isCodeRelated`|Whether the output style is code related|

e.g.

```markdown
---
name: Miao
description: Adds "miao~~~" after every sentence for a cute cat-like style
isCodeRelated: false
---

You should add "miao~~~" after every sentence.
```
