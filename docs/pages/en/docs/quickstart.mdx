# Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with Neovate Code in minutes.

## Before you start

- [Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
- A terminal opened
- A project to work on

## Step 1: Install Neovate Code

Install Neovate Code using the following command:

```bash
npm i @neovate/code -g
```

Then run `neovate --version` to verify the installation.

## Step 2: Configure Providers and Select Model

If you don't have a provider and model configured, Neovate Code will prompt you to configure them when you start it.

```bash
neovate
```

## Step 4: Run the first task

Choose a task to run.

```bash
> explain this project
> create a testcase for @src/components/Button.tsx
> what is the purpose of this project
> analyze the dependencies of this project
```

## Step 5: Review the changes

Once the task is completed, git stage the changes.

```bash
git add .
```

Then use the `/review` slash command to review the changes. Neovate Code will diff the changes and show you the recommendations including performance improvements, security issues, code style, etc.

```bash
neovate /review
```

## Step 6: Commit the changes

Once the review is completed, use `neovate commit` to generate a commit message, commit and push.

```bash
neovate commit
```
