# Interactive Mode

Neovate Code supports both interactive mode and headless mode. And interactive mode is the default mode.

Running `neovate` in the terminal will start the interactive mode for the current working directory.

```bash
neovate
```

Or you can start it with a specific working directory.

```bash
neovate --cwd /path/to/your/project
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Shift + Tab` | Switch to the plan mode |
| `Up/Down Arrows` | Navigate the conversation history |
| `/` | Start slash commands |
| `Ctrl + C` twice | Quit |
| `Shift + Enter` or `Option + Enter` | Multi-line input |
| `Ctrl + L` twice | Open the debug mode and open the log file |

## File references

You can use `@` to refer to the files and directories in the current working directory. It will do a fuzzy search and suggest the file or directory name of the best match. Then you can hit `Tab` or `Enter` to select.

```bash
neovate "version of @package.json"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Refered files and directories using `@` will be added to the context. If you just want to refer to the file content, just hit `Tab` and it will also do the fuzzy search auto suggestion.
</Callout>

## Conversation history

Some tips about the conversation history:

- History is stored per working directory in the `~/.neovate/projects/<project_name>/` directory and named as `<session_id>.jsonl`.
- Use `-r, --resume` to resume from a specific session.
- Use `-c, --continue` to resume from the last session.
- Use `Up/Down Arrows` to navigate the conversation history.
- Use `/clear` to clear the conversation history and start a new session (Notice: original conversation session is kept).

## Multimodal input

You can add images to the conversation, such as screenshots, diagrams, etc.

There are several ways to add:

- Drag and drop images to the input area.
- Copy and paste images to the input area.
