# Models

## Providers

Neovate Code supports most popular providers and models by default. And you can also add any OpenAI compatible provider. Check out the [Providers](./providers) page to learn more.

## Select a model

Once you have configured the providers, you can run `/model` to select a model. The selected model will be saved in the global settings in the `~/.neovate/config.json` file.

```bash
/model
```

Also, you can use `neovate config` to select a model.

```bash
# Set global model
neovate config set model openai/gpt-4o -g

# Set project model
neovate config set model openai/gpt-4o

# Get global model
neovate config get model -g
```

## Recommended models

Here are so many models, and we can't test all of them. Here are some recommended models which have been tested and are working well.

- Claude Sonnet 4
- Claude Opus 4
- Qwen3 Coder
- Qwen3 Max
- GPT 4.1
- Gemini 2.5 Pro

## Specify a model temporarily

You can specify a model temporarily by adding `-m, --model` to your command. The format is `provider_id/model_id`. It's priority is higher than the model configured in the settings.

```bash
neovate -m openai/gpt-4o "Create a testcase for @src/components/Button.tsx"
```

## Model Aliases

Model aliases are shortcuts for models. You can use them to quickly select a model.

```bash
neovate -m 4o
```
