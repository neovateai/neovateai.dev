## Development

It's recommended to use [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage the node version.

Make sure the bun's version is 1.2.7 before run build.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.2.7"
```

Install.

```bash
npm i
```

Run the project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Test the build version.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

It will start the development server for the documentation.

```bash
▲ Next.js 14.2.32
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```
