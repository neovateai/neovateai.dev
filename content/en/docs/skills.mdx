# Skills

Skills are **reusable capabilities** that your AI agent invokes on demand. They pack instructions, expertise, and tools into a lightweight package.

**Key properties:**

- **Model-invoked** – Neovate decides when to use them based on the task, not typed commands
- **Composable** – can be chained together as part of larger workflows
- **Token-efficient** – lightweight and focused

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a **directory** containing:

- `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions
- Optional supporting files (scripts, schemas, checklists)

Each skill defines what problem it solves, what inputs it expects, and what success looks like.

## File Locations

| Scope | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Plugin** | Provided by plugins via the `skill` hook | Skills bundled with npm packages |
| **Workspace** | `.neovate/skills/<skill-name>/` | Project skills shared with teammates; checked into git |
| **Personal** | `~/.neovate/skills/<skill-name>/` | Private skills that follow you across projects |

<Callout type="info">
  For compatibility, `.claude/skills/` is also supported as an alias.
</Callout>

### Loading Priority

Skills are loaded in the following order, with later sources overriding earlier ones:

1. **Plugin** – Skills provided by plugins (lowest priority)
2. **Config** – Skills specified via the `skills` config option
3. **Global (~/.claude/)** – Legacy global skills
4. **Global (~/.neovate/)** – Personal global skills
5. **Project (.claude/)** – Legacy project skills
6. **Project (.neovate/)** – Project-specific skills (highest priority)

## Skill File Format

Skills are defined in Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```md
---
name: summarize-diff
description: Summarize the staged git diff in 3–5 bullets. Use when the user asks for a summary of pending changes.
---

# Summarize Diff

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged`.
2. Summarize the changes in 3–5 bullets, focusing on user-visible behavior.
3. Call out any migrations, risky areas, or tests that should be run.
```

The `name` and `description` fields are required. Neovate uses the description to decide when to apply the skill.

## Supporting Files

Each skill folder can contain supporting utilities:

- `SKILL.md` – the main skill specification

## Skills as Slash Commands

Skills can also be invoked directly as slash commands. When a skill is loaded, it automatically registers as a slash command using its name (e.g., a skill named `frontend-design` becomes `/frontend-design`).

**Key points:**
- Skills only register as commands when no existing command shares the same name
- The command description shows "(global skill)" or "(project skill)" to indicate the source
- Skills support parameter placeholders: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. for individual arguments, or `$ARGUMENTS` for all arguments

## How Skills Differ from Other Config

| Config | Purpose | When it runs |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Skills** | Specialized knowledge invoked by the model | Model chooses when relevant, or user types `/skill-name` |
| **Rules (AGENTS.md)** | Project-wide instructions | Loaded into every conversation |
| **Slash Commands** | User-invoked macros | You type `/command` to run it |

## CLI Commands

Manage skills via the command line:

```bash
# Install a skill from GitHub
neovate skill add user/repo

# Install from a subpath
neovate skill add user/repo/path/to/skill

# Interactively select which skills to install
neovate skill add -i user/repo

# Install globally (available across all projects)
neovate skill add -g user/repo

# Install to Claude skills directory
neovate skill add --claude user/repo

# Install with a custom name
neovate skill add --name my-skill user/repo

# Overwrite an existing skill
neovate skill add --overwrite user/repo

# List all installed skills
neovate skill list

# List as JSON
neovate skill list --json

# Remove a skill
neovate skill remove my-skill

# Remove a global skill
neovate skill remove -g my-skill
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-g, --global` | Install to/remove from global skills directory |
| `-i, --interactive` | Interactively select which skills to install |
| `--claude` | Install to Claude skills directory (.claude/skills) |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite existing skill with the same name |
| `--name <name>` | Install with a custom local name |
| `--target <dir>` | Custom target directory for skills |
| `--json` | Output list as JSON |

## Configuration

You can specify additional skill paths in your config file:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "/path/to/custom/SKILL.md",
    "/path/to/skills/directory"
  ]
}
```

Each entry can be either a path to a `SKILL.md` file or a directory containing one. See [Settings](./settings) for more details.
