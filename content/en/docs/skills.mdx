# Skills

Skills are **reusable capabilities** that your AI agent invokes on demand. They pack instructions, expertise, and tools into a lightweight package.

**Key properties:**

- **Model-invoked** – Neovate decides when to use them based on the task, not typed commands
- **Composable** – can be chained together as part of larger workflows
- **Token-efficient** – lightweight and focused

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a **directory** containing:

- `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions
- Optional supporting files (scripts, schemas, checklists)

Each skill defines what problem it solves, what inputs it expects, and what success looks like.

## File Locations

| Scope | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Workspace** | `.neovate/skills/<skill-name>/` | Project skills shared with teammates; checked into git |
| **Personal** | `~/.neovate/skills/<skill-name>/` | Private skills that follow you across projects |

<Callout type="info">
  For compatibility, `.claude/skills/` is also supported as an alias.
</Callout>

## Skill File Format

Skills are defined in Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```md
---
name: summarize-diff
description: Summarize the staged git diff in 3–5 bullets. Use when the user asks for a summary of pending changes.
---

# Summarize Diff

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged`.
2. Summarize the changes in 3–5 bullets, focusing on user-visible behavior.
3. Call out any migrations, risky areas, or tests that should be run.
```

The `name` and `description` fields are required. Neovate uses the description to decide when to apply the skill.

## Supporting Files

Each skill folder can contain supporting utilities:

- `SKILL.md` – the main skill specification

## How Skills Differ from Other Config

| Config | Purpose | When it runs |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Skills** | Specialized knowledge invoked by the model | Model chooses when relevant |
| **Rules (AGENTS.md)** | Project-wide instructions | Loaded into every conversation |
| **Slash Commands** | User-invoked macros | You type `/command` to run it |
