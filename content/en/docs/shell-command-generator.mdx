# Shell Command Generator

Convert natural language to shell commands using AI and optionally execute them.

## Quick Start

```bash
neovate run "list all files in current directory"
```

This opens interactive mode where you can review the generated command and choose an action.

For immediate execution:

```bash
neovate run --yes "create a backup of config.json"
```

## Features

- **Natural language conversion** - Describe what you want in plain English, get the exact shell command
- **Interactive action selector** - Execute, copy, edit, or regenerate before running
- **Command editing** - Modify the generated command before execution
- **Prompt editing** - Refine your description to regenerate a better command
- **Auto-execution** - Skip confirmation with `--yes` flag

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-m, --model <model>` | Specify model to use |
| `-q, --quiet` | Output only the generated command (no UI, for scripting) |
| `--yes` | Execute the command without confirmation |
| `-h, --help` | Show help |

## Interactive Actions

When a command is generated, you can choose from these actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Execute command** | Run the generated command immediately |
| **Copy to clipboard** | Copy the command for use elsewhere |
| **Edit command** | Modify the command before executing |
| **Edit prompt & regenerate** | Refine your description and generate a new command |
| **Cancel** | Exit without executing |

Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select. Press Esc to cancel at any time.

## Examples

List files modified in the last 7 days:

```bash
neovate run "find all files modified in last 7 days"
```

Search for a pattern in code:

```bash
neovate run "search for TODO comments in all JavaScript files"
```

Execute without confirmation:

```bash
neovate run --yes "show disk usage"
```

Use a specific model:

```bash
neovate run -m claude-sonnet "compress all images in current directory"
```

## Configuration

You can set a default model in your settings:

```json
{
  "smallModel": "claude-haiku"
}
```

The run command uses `smallModel` by default for faster responses. See [Settings](/docs/settings) for more configuration options.

## Quiet Mode

Use `-q` or `--quiet` for non-interactive usage, ideal for scripting and piping:

```bash
neovate run -q "list all files"
```

Pipe the output to other commands:

```bash
neovate run -q "find large files over 100MB" | sh
neovate run -q "list git branches" | pbcopy
```

Behavior:
- Outputs only the generated command to stdout (no interactive UI)
- Exits with code 0 on success, code 1 on error
- Requires a prompt (errors if missing)
