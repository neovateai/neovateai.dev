## Custom slash commands

<Callout type="info">
  Custom slash commands can override the built-in slash commands. If you define a custom slash command with the same name as a built-in slash command, the custom slash command will be used instead.
</Callout>

If you write a prompt more than three times, you should consider adding a slash command for it. Customized slash commands have both project and global scope.

### Project scope

Located under the `.neovate/commands` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p .neovate/commands
echo "Add test case for $ARGUMENTS" > .neovate/commands/add-testcase.md
```

<Callout type="info">
  For compatibility, `.claude/commands` is also supported as a project-level commands directory.
</Callout>

### Global scope

Located under the `~/.neovate/commands` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.neovate/commands
echo "Explain the project dependencies" > ~/.neovate/commands/explain-dependencies.md
```

<Callout type="info">
  For compatibility, `~/.claude/commands` is also supported as a global commands directory.
</Callout>

### Usage

```bash
/<command> [arguments]
```

### Arguments

The `$ARGUMENTS` string in your slash command file will be replaced with **all** the arguments passed to the command.

e.g.

```bash
echo "Add test case for $ARGUMENTS" > .neovate/commands/add-testcase.md

# Usage
/add-testcase @src/Button.tsx
# Actual prompt will be used
Add test case for @src/Button.tsx
```

And if you want to replace individual arguments, you can use the `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. Similarly as the bash script.

```bash
echo "Install dependency $1 with $2" > .neovate/commands/add-dependency.md

# Usage
/add-dependency react pnpm
# Actual prompt will be used
Install dependency react with pnpm
```

### Frontmatter

Slash command files support frontmatter.

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`name (optional)`|The name of the slash command|
|`description (optional)`|The description of the slash command|
|`model (optional)`|The model to use for the slash command|

e.g.

```bash
---
name: Add test case
description: Add a test case for the given file
model: openai/gpt-5
---

Add test case for $ARGUMENTS
```
