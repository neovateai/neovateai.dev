# Rules

Neovate Code supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) file to provide custom instructions. You can use it to manage custom rules to guide AI behavior and ensure consistent code generation across your projects.

<Callout type="info">
  For compatibility, `CLAUDE.md` is also supported as an alias for `AGENTS.md`.
</Callout>

## File Location

Neovate Code supports both project and global scope. And both of them will work, they will be merged together to send to the LLMs.

### Project scope

Project scope `AGENTS.md` is located under your project root. This file will be used by the project and it's sub-directories.

### Global scope

You can also create a global AGENTS.md file in the `~/.neovate/AGENTS.md`. This file will be used by all projects.

## Set up project AGENTS.md

You can use `/init` slash command to set up a project `AGENTS.md` file quickly using **progressive disclosure principles**:

- The root `AGENTS.md` stays minimal (\<60 lines) with only high-level guidance
- Detailed information goes into separate `docs/agent/*.md` files (e.g., `development_commands.md`, `architecture.md`, `testing.md`, `conventions.md`)
- Only creates additional docs where substantial content exists

If the `AGENTS.md` file already exists, it will ask before replacing.

```bash
/init
```

<Callout type="info">
  You should commit the `AGENTS.md` file of your project to the git repository.
</Callout>
