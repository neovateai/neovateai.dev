# Quick Start

Get started with Neovate Code in minutes. By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to use AI-powered coding assistance for common development tasks.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Terminal access
- A coding project

## Step 1: Install Neovate Code

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm i @neovate/code -g
```

Verify installation:

```bash
neovate --version
```

## Step 2: Initial Setup

Navigate to your project and start Neovate Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
neovate
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to configure a provider:

1. Type `/login` and select your AI provider
2. Open the URL to complete OAuth login, or enter your API key directly

3. Type `/model` to choose a model

## Step 3: Ask Your First Question

You're now in interactive mode. Start by understanding your codebase:

```bash
> what does this project do?
```

Neovate will analyze your files and provide a summary. Try more specific questions:

```bash
> what technologies does this project use?
> where is the main entry point?
> explain the folder structure
> analyze the dependencies of this project
```

Neovate reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context.

## Step 4: Make Your First Code Change

Now let's make Neovate do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```bash
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Neovate will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

You can also reference specific files using `@`:

```bash
> create a testcase for @src/components/Button.tsx
> add input validation to @src/forms/LoginForm.tsx
```

Neovate always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable auto-accept mode for a session.

## Step 5: Use Git with Neovate

Neovate makes Git operations conversational:

```bash
> what files have I changed?
> show me the diff
> create a new branch called feature/login
```

Review your changes before committing:

```bash
git add .
neovate /review
```

Generate a commit message and commit with AI assistance:

```bash
neovate commit
```

Or do it conversationally:

```bash
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
> show me the last 5 commits
```

## Step 6: Fix a Bug or Add a Feature

Neovate excels at debugging and feature implementation. Describe what you want in natural language:

```bash
> add input validation to the user registration form
> implement dark mode toggle in the settings page
```

Or fix existing issues:

```bash
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
> the login page shows a blank screen after wrong credentials - debug it
```

Neovate will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## Step 7: Other Common Workflows

**Refactor code**

```bash
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await
> extract the validation logic into a separate utility
```

**Write tests**

```bash
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
> add integration tests for the API endpoints
```

**Update documentation**

```bash
> update the README with installation instructions
> add JSDoc comments to the exported functions
```

**Code review**

```bash
> review my changes and suggest improvements
> check for potential security issues
```

## Tips

- Use `/logout` to switch accounts or providers
- Use `/help` to discover all available slash commands
- Run `/init` to create a project-level `AGENTS.md` rules file
- Set `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable if you're behind a firewall
- Be specific with your requests - instead of "fix the bug", try "fix the login bug where users see a blank screen"
- Let Neovate explore first - ask it to analyze your code before making changes

## What's Next?

After you've completed the quickstart, explore more features:

- [CLI](./cli.mdx) - All commands and options
- [Settings](./settings.mdx) - Customize Neovate for your workflow
